Notes

    1. Image Paths: Ensure you replace 'path/to/image1.png' and 'path/to/image2.png' with actual paths to your image files.
    2. Game Logic: You can expand the onClick functions to include more complex game logic, such as changing scenes, interacting with other objects, or updating the game state.
    3. Inventory Management: This example shows a basic inventory system. You can enhance it by adding item images, descriptions, or interaction functionalities.
